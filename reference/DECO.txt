Abstract
Diffusion models usher a new era of video editing, flexibly manipulating the video contents with text prompts. Despite the widespread application demand in editing human-centered videos, these models face significant challenges in handling complex objects like humans. In this paper, we introduce DeCo, a novel video editing framework specifically designed to treat humans and the background as separate editable targets, ensuring global spatial-temporal consistency by maintaining the coherence of each individual component. Specifically, we propose a decoupled dynamic human representation that utilizes a parametric human body prior to generate tailored humans while preserving the consistent motions as the original video. In addition, we consider the background as a layered atlas to apply text-guided image editing approaches on it. To further enhance the geometry and texture of humans during the optimization, we extend the calculation of score distillation sampling into normal space and image space. Moreover, we tackle inconsistent lighting between the edited targets by leveraging a lighting-aware video harmonizer, a problem previously overlooked in decompose-edit-combine approaches. Extensive qualitative and numerical experiments demonstrate that DeCo outperforms prior video editing methods in human-centered videos, especially in longer videos.

1Introduction
Text-driven video editing has achieved remarkable advances with the emergence of diffusion models [20, 65, 67, 77, 78], which have garnered widespread acclaim for their user-friendly characteristics. Given the significant application value of human-centered videos across various fields, such as movie production, virtual try-on, and gaming, delving into editing these videos becomes paramount. With the strides achieved by diffusion models in text-guided image editing [19, 51, 49, 2, 69], a natural solution would be to extend these approaches to the video domain. Nevertheless, propagating the edited content throughout the entire video still poses a formidable challenge. Beyond performing precise edits that adhere to text prompts, it’s imperative to maintain a motion trajectory consistent with the original video.

To enhance frame-wise editing, pioneer Tune-A-Video [74] leverages Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models to edit the video through tuning the spatial-temporal attention module during the reconstruction of the original video. Following works [6, 56, 40, 76, 37] integrate condition maps (e.g., depth, edges) or optical flow into their frameworks to ensure temporal smoothness and control over the structure. However, they are both plagued by problems of appearance distortion and structural flickering as the number of frames increases. Several works [50, 31] explore novel video representations with an objective: to transform videos into a unified image format. This transformation allows for the direct utilization of image-based processing algorithms across the entire video, circumventing the conventional method of processing it frame by frame. CoDeF [50] encodes video content within a canonical field, subsequently utilizing a deformation field to warp the canonical image to the video frames over the temporal dimension. CoDeF excels in adapting image algorithms for video processing. However, it struggles with local adjustments due to the global treatment of the canonical image. Neural Layered Atlases (NLA) [31] maps each pixel of every frame in the video to a corresponding 2D uv map. Pixels are sampled based on their uv coordinates to create an atlas representing the editable object (or background). One can significantly maintain temporal consistency by editing the atlas and mapping it back to the video according to uv coordinates. Building on NLA, [1, 7, 33] implement flexible manipulation over the editable atlas, enhancing the control of edits. However, these approaches composite the edited objects onto the background without considering the need for harmonization between them. Furthermore, they often encounter challenges in dealing with complex objects such as humans, who exhibit intricate appearances and non-rigid movements within videos.

In this paper, we propose DeCo, an innovative video editing framework centred on human motion consistency, aiming to render the target human with diverse appearances and shapes within a text-specified scene. Instead of propagating key frames across the entire video, we consider the background and humans as separate targets for editing. Specifically, we employ depth-guided image algorithms to edit the background represented as a layered atlas for temporal consistency. To avoid spatial distortion between frames caused by the coupling of appearance and dynamic motions, we leverage an explicit human body prior, SMPL-X [53], to drive the human with motion sequences. This harness the power of 3D human pose estimation methods [34, 3, 73, 79, 57, 83], which can regress the pose parameters of SMPL-X from a video sequence to represent a minimally clothed human mesh. In order to tailor the mesh to conform to text prompts, we optimize it under the canonical pose with vertex-based displacements and a texture map using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), where the denoising scores are computed not only in the latent space but also in the normal space and image space to enhance geometry and texture details. As prior methods [7, 1, 33] composite the rendered atlases directly without considering lighting consistency, we propose a video harmonizer to ensure harmonization of their albedo and shading maps, making the whole video appear realistic through relighting the objects. Fig. 1 showcases results from both independent and combined edits. Overall, our contributions are summarized as follows:

• We design a human-centered, text-guided video editing framework that facilitates diverse editing of both scenes and humans. A decoupled dynamic human representation is proposed to ensure consistent motions based on a parametric human body prior, which avoids distortion induced by the coupling of appearance and complex motions. Additionally, we edit scenes within the layered atlas space to preserve temporal coherence.
• We enhance the geometry and texture details of humans by extending the score distillation process into both normal and image space.
• We propose a lighting-aware video harmonizer to ensure lighting consistency between the edited targets.

2.1Diffusion-based Video Editing
Recent advancements in extending diffusion-based image editing methods [81, 61, 2, 32] to the video domain have seen notable progress. Works like Tune-A-Video [74] inflate spatial self-attention layers into spatial-temporal self-attention layers for enhanced temporal modelling, calculating sparse causal attention between initial and preceding frames. FateZero [56] merges self-attention and cross-attention feature maps from both DDIM inversion and denoising processes. Video-P2P [40] extends Prompt-to-Prompt [19] to videos by optimizing a shared unconditional embedding for video inversion. TokenFlow [14] preserves the inter-frame correspondence and redundancies of the original video features within the edited features. Structural guidance, such as depth maps and optical flow, is increasingly integrated into frameworks for spatial constraints [82, 44]. Rerender A Video [76] employs edge maps and optical flow to impose cross-frame shape constraints. However, temporal consistency remains a challenge, particularly in longer videos, due to the intrinsic deficiency in extending T2I models into the video domain.

Several approaches propose novel video diffusion models or represent video inputs in different forms. Gen-1 [13] and VideoComposer [72] develop video diffusion models, receiving different condition maps to steer the generation of motion and appearance in videos. CoDeF [50] decomposes videos into the canonical content field and temporal deformation field. These methods frequently face issues with separating objects from their backgrounds during the editing process, making it hard to achieve precise manipulation. Text2live [1] separates editable objects from the background in videos using 2D neural layered atlases (NLA) [31]. In NLA, positions in the video are mapped to their corresponding locations within each atlas layer, enabling targeted editing. [33] allows for shape editing that relies on dense semantic correspondence learning. StableVideo [7] leverages depth cues to guide background edits and uses canny edge detection for object modification. While these NLA-based methods succeed in creating coherent video frames, they encounter challenges in editing complex objects like humans, often leading to distorted appearances. Moreover, these methods overlook the crucial aspect of harmonizing edited objects with their backgrounds, which is essential for maintaining visual consistency.

2.2Text-driven Human Generation
Avatar-CLIP [22] initializes 3D human geometry via a shape VAE network and harnesses the power of CLIP loss [58] to refine geometry and texture. DreamFusion [55] introduces the SDS loss and optimizes NeRF [48] under the strong image prior to the T2I diffusion model. However, Text-to-3D efforts [8, 55, 36, 10, 84] struggle to produce high-fidelity human meshes when tasked with generating text-driven 3D humans. DreamAvatar [4] and AvatarCraft [27] leverage the parameterized SMPL model as a shape prior, yet their ability to obtain complex human attributes such as clothing and hair remains limited. Addressing this, Dreamwaltz [25] enhances the SDS loss with a 3D-aware skeleton conditioning, while Humannorm [24] and AvatarVerse [80] employ the hybrid 3D representation DMTet [63], along with structural condition maps, for more detailed and realistic geometrical outputs. Notwithstanding the high quality of static human meshes these methods can create, the necessity of a rigged skeleton for animation introduces significant computational demands, particularly for dynamic video scenes. TADA [38] expands upon the upsampled SMPL-X model [53], integrating a displacement layer and texture map to support the generation of diverse and animated characters. However, TADA blends the SDS loss from image and normal maps without constraints, leading to results that fall short of satisfaction.

2.3Image and Video Harmonization
Image harmonization aims to blend foreground and background seamlessly within a composite image by aligning their illumination and colour statistics. Scs-co [18] incorporates contrastive learning into the harmonization. [64] leverages semantic features derived from pre-trained models. [68] focus on the correlation and decorrelation within dual colour space. [16] proposes a transformer-based architecture for image harmonization. Furthermore, [5, 17] apply intrinsic image decomposition to image harmonization, separating the composite image into reflectance and illumination for targeted harmonization. Harmonizing composite frames individually using image harmonization techniques can lead to flickers and artifacts. [23] and [42] utilize optical flow and colour mapping consistency, respectively, to ensure consistency between adjacent frames throughout the harmonized video sequence.

3Preliminaries
Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) is an extension of DDPM [20], which generates images by progressively reducing noise starting from Gaussian noise, aiming to save memory by operating in the latent space. Specifically, LDM, comprising both an encoder and a decoder, encodes an image into a low-resolution latent code 
z
, which can subsequently be reconstructed back into the image space with the decoder. The initial latent code 
z
0
 evolves into 
z
t
 over time step 
t
 through the introduction of random noise 
ϵ
, sampled from a standard normal distribution. To reverse this diffusion process, a U-Net [62] noise predictor 
ϵ
ϕ
 parameterized by 
ϕ
 is trained using the loss function:

4Methods
DeCo aims to edit human-centered videos to comply with target text prompts, enabling the generation of dynamic humans with high-fidelity appearances and coherent motions. As illustrated in Fig. 2, we treat humans and the background as separate editable targets. We represent the background as a layered atlas using NLA and edit it with diffusion models under the guidance of depth map (Sec. 4.1). We propose a decoupled dynamic human representation based on a human body prior SMPL-X [41] to generate high-fidelity tailored human meshes through extended SDS loss (Sec. 4.2). Moreover, we introduce a lighting-aware video harmonizer to maintain lighting consistency between edited targets (Sec. 4.3).

4.1Background Atlas Editing
To propagate the contents with temporal consistency, NLA [31] decomposes a dynamic scene into a collection of atlases, each representing a target for editing. The approach utilizes two coordinate-based MLPs: the first maps pixels in each frame to a UV field, while the second constructs atlases by sampling uv coordinates. In this section, we only consider the construction of the background atlas. Formally, given a video 
V
=
(
I

,
I

,
…
,
I

)
 with N denoting the number of frames in the video, we establish UV mapping

 as follows:

where

 back to the original video for reconstruction loss, we can train these two mapping networks. Once trained, they can be directly applied for editing without further updates. Subsequently, we employ a pre-trained depth-guided diffusion model

 (e.g., ControlNet [81]) to edit

4.2Decoupled Dynamic Human Representation
Non-rigid objects such as humans encounter large deformation during moving, easily leading to distorted appearances and incoherent motions. To tackle this problem, we decouple the dynamic human into text-driven geometry and appearance optimization and pose-dependent animation through explicitly leveraging a human body prior SMPL-X [12].

Text-driven Geometry and Appearance Optimization. With fixed pose parameters 
θ
, we learn the geometry and appearance of the human mesh customized to the text prompt under the canonical pose. To generate expressive human meshes, we add learnable displacements 
𝐃
 on the template of SMPL-X [12, 52]. Given the sparse distribution of vertices on the SMPL-X body’s surface, we refine the mesh by subdividing these vertices and interpolating the skinning weights, similar to [38]. Moreover, since the mesh aligned with SMPL-X has fixed topology structure, the texture of it can be defined as a learnable texture map 
𝚿
. Thus, Eq. 3 can be improved as follows:

)
+

(6)
where 
𝒮
 denotes vertices subdivision operation.

We optimize the mesh’s learnable parameters using the SDS loss proposed in [55], which leverages a T2I diffusion model [61] to guide the 3D generation, aligning the rendered image with the learned image distribution. However, the SDS loss is calculated in the latent space to save memory costs, which easily tends to converge to inaccurate shapes like cartoon-like bodies without finetuning the T2I diffusion model on realistic human datasets. To address this issue, we propose to extend it in both image and normal space to constrain the generation of geometric shapes and to produce high-fidelity textures during the denoising process. Concretely, with 
𝐓
^
, we first render its RGB image 
I
r
 and normal map 
I
N
 from a sampled camera pose as the integration of normal maps into the SDS loss has been shown to improve geometric consistency with texture [38, 24]. As illustrated in Fig. 2, 
I
r
 and 
I
N
 are then encoded into 
z
r
 and 
z
n
, respectively. Inspired by [84], the noise residual of Eq. 2 can be reformulated as latent vector residual. In terms of the noisy normal latent vector 
z
n
, we can denoise it using the noise predictor 
ϵ
^
ϕ
, and denote the denoised result as 
z

Pose-dependent Animation. To animate the generated mesh in alignment with the original video’s pose, we employ 3D pose estimation approaches to derive pose parameters for the controllable mesh from a monocular video. Specifically, we apply HybrIK [34] to acquire the estimated pose parameters

4.3Lighting-Aware Video Harmonizer
Illumination discrepancies may arise if the edited human is directly rendered into the edited scene. To solve the issue, we propose a simple yet effective lighting-aware video harmonizer to maintain the lighting consistency between the edited targets, which is ignored in the prior methods. We consider the harmonization problem as the combination of the intrinsic consistency of albedo maps and shading, treating an image as the product of material reflectance and scene lighting effects. To harmonize the albedo maps, we employ an off-the-shelf image editing network [46] to regress sets of editing parameters, allowing for adjustments to exposure, white balance and other image attributes. The shading harmonization is divided into two stages. Concretely, we first estimate the shading of the background using the Lambertian shading model, exploiting a lighting model to shade each pixel of the background based on the surface normal, which incorporates a directional light source and a constant ambient illumination. Applying the lighting model to the surface normal of the foreground, we can achieve the initial shading harmonization. Subsequently, we utilize a pre-trained shading refinement network proposed by [5] to refine the global shading, which takes as inputs the foreground mask, the RGB composite image (product of the harmonized albedo map and the initial harmonized shading), the initial shading, the surface normal and the depth map to output the refined shading. Note that the above-mentioned pre-trained models are both trained in the wild datasets, as we can employ them to our task without considering domain gaps. The final harmonized image is the product of the harmonized albedo map and the refined shading. We extend the harmonization to the video by adding an exponential moving average to each frame, which preserves the lighting smoothness across frames.

5.1Implementation Details.
We train two mapping networks for background atlas editing through 300,000 iterations of each video. The resolution for the background was set to 768 
×
 432, and we employ a DDIM [66] sampler with 20 steps. During the stage of text-driven geometry and appearance optimization, we sample the corresponding camera poses separately for rendering the full body and the head. In addition, we utilize hierarchical rendering to render RGB images, scaling from 32 
×
 32 to 512 
×
 512 while maintaining the rendered normal map at a resolution of 512 
×
 512. During the joint training of geometry and texture, the geometry is fixed after 50 iterations, while the texture is trained for 150 iterations. The corresponding loss weights, 
λ
n
 and 
λ
r
 are both set to 1.

5.2Baseline Comparisons.
Dateset. To evaluate our approach, we employ the videos from Neuman [28] and Hosnerf [39] datasets. The former comprises six videos, each ranging from 10 to 20 seconds in length, while the latter consists of six videos as well, with durations between 60 to 120 seconds each. We also select several human-related videos from 3DPW [70] to further evaluate our DeCo. The prompts used for editing are generated from ChatGPT, which are introduced in the supplementary material.

Baselines. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DeCo, we perform a comparative analysis against the following baseline methods. 1) Tune-A-Video [74] is the pioneering work that extends T2I models to video domains. 2) StableVideo [7] utilizes NLA to decompose the video editing into foreground and background editing, using the object edges and depth maps as the structure guidance. 3) TokenFlow [14] maintains the inter-frame correspondences and redundancy observed in the original video for temporal consistency. 4) Rerender-A-Video [76] leverages optical flow for cross-frame constraints to enhance the propagation of edited frames. To ensure a fair comparison, for methods requiring tuning a video on the model, such as Tune-A-Video, we extract image captions from their key frames using the BLIP model [35]. Subsequently, we replace phrases related to edited objects and the background with the desired prompt while retaining the rest unchanged.

Refer to caption
Figure 3:Qualitative comparisons of our DeCo and four representative video editing methods. DeCo achieves much more satisfactory results in terms of video quality and motion consistency.
Qualitative Comparison. To better demonstrate the motion consistency of the edited video, we showcase five frames that are more than 10 frames apart in Fig. 3. Tune-A-Video [74] can generate coherent frames. However, it struggles to maintain the consistency of human motions from the original video. The results generated by StableVideo [7] indicate that utilizing a diffusion model conditioned on canny edges is insufficient for editing complex objects like humans. Additionally, it is unable to modify the shapes of humans, which limits the diversity of the edited human. TokenFlow [14] produces results similar to the original video, with only minor changes in the facial area.

Refer to caption
Figure 4:Text-guided human generation methods. TADA [38] encounters several issues, such as cartoon-like body shapes (Sherlock Holmes), blurry patterns (Spiderman), and misalignment with the prompts (Aquaman).
The results produced by Rerender-A-Video [76] exhibit blurriness in both the foreground and background. Overall, none of them can simultaneously ensure the quality of the edited video and maintain motion consistency as the source video. In comparison, our DeCo not only generates diverse humans with high-fidelity appearances in response to different prompts but also enables complex animation with target pose sequences, which effectively avoids appearance distortions caused by changes in motion. We further conduct a qualitative analysis comparing our proposed text-guided human generation method with alternative approaches. Note that as we construct the humans based on SMPL-X, our comparison is limited to those human generation methods conditioned on the SMPL model. From Fig. 4, TEXTure [60] generates humans with poor texture, failing to accurately depict the human body. AvatarCLIP [22] struggles to represent character-specific vertex displacements. While TADA [38] is capable of generating diverse humans, it faces challenges in creating humans that are closely aligned with the text, featuring high-fidelity textures and realistic body shapes.

Quantitative Comparison. We quantify DeCo against baselines using CLIP [58] metrics across 13 scenes from three datasets, with each scene corresponding to two characters, amounting to a total of 26 videos. To gauge the frame consistency of edited videos, we extract CLIP [58] image embeddings for all frames and compute the average cosine similarity among the adjacent frames. To evaluate textual faithfulness, we calculate the CLIP scores by comparing all video frames with their target prompts. As shown in Tab. 1, our method achieves the best frame consistency and textual faithfulness. We also conduct a user study to evaluate DeCo. We select 13 groups of videos, each corresponding to a different scene. For each group, users are shown the original video alongside its corresponding target prompts, followed by five edited videos that are generated by various methods and randomly arranged. We invite 15 volunteers to rank each group of videos based on their temporal consistency, editing ability, and image quality. The scoring system ranges from 5, being the highest, to 1, the lowest, with no repeated scores allowed. The final report will present the average scores across all groups. From Tab. 1, our method achieves the highest human preference in all aspects.

5.3Ablation Study
Extending SDS loss to normal and image space. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the Obama in the first column exhibits an unrealistic head-to-shoulder ratio, making it appear less authentic. Moreover, the patterns of the Jokers are blurry. Additionally, as observed in the second column, employing only the reconstruction loss in the normal and image spaces yields suboptimal results. We argue that this is due to performing only a single step in the denoising process, which does not ensure high-quality denoised noises. However, the guidance provided by the SDS loss facilitates a more rapid convergence to a plausible human shape and appearance. The third column demonstrates that incorporating 
ℒ

 into geometry learning results in a realistic body shape. As shown in the fourth column, integrating 
ℒ

 into the texture learning generates sharper textures. In the fifth column, we achieve lifelike humans with high-fidelity textures.

Video Harmonizer. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the first row demonstrates a noticeable inconsistency between Aladdin’s brightness and the background when the video harmonizer is not applied. Note that the second and third columns reveal that our proposed video harmonizer is aware of lighting occlusions, effectively portraying shadows when sunlight is obstructed. In the second video, the harmonizer adjusts Iron man to a cool tone, aligning with the lighting expected in a snowy scene. With the incorporation of the video harmonizer, the frame achieves lighting consistency.

6Limitations and Future Works
For each video, our method is required to train its atlas mapping networks individually, which introduces additional time costs. In the future, we aim to discover more efficient zero-shot methods for representing video foreground and background. Furthermore, our human pose parameters are derived from existing 3D pose estimation techniques, inheriting their limitations.

7Conclusion
We propose an innovative video editing framework designed for independent editing of humans and backgrounds to maintain spatial-temporal consistency. By leveraging a parametric human prior, our approach decouples dynamic humans from motions, enabling the generation of diverse shapes and appearances under the canonical pose. We extend the SDS loss to the image and normal space to enhance the geometry and texture details. Additionally, a novel lighting-aware video harmonizer addresses the inconsistent lighting problem between edited targets.
