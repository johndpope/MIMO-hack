### **Recipe for Implementing the MIMO Framework**

**Objective**: Develop a codebase that implements the MIMO framework to synthesize controllable character videos with attributes like character, motion, and scene, based on simple user inputs.

#### **1. Understand the Framework**

- **Study the Paper Thoroughly**: Begin by carefully reading the paper to understand:
  - The overall architecture and components of the MIMO framework.
  - The methodologies used for spatial decomposition, encoding, and decoding.
  - The training process, including loss functions and optimization strategies.

- **Identify Key Components**:
  - **Hierarchical Spatial Layer Decomposition**: Separating video frames into human, scene, and occlusion components.
  - **Disentangled Human Encoding**: Encoding identity and motion separately.
  - **Scene and Occlusion Encoding**: Encoding background and occluding objects.
  - **Composed Decoding**: Reconstructing the video using a diffusion-based decoder.
  - **Training Strategy**: Jointly training the encoders and decoder with specific loss functions.

#### **2. Set Up the Development Environment**

- **Programming Language**: Use **Python** for its extensive support in deep learning and computer vision.

- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - **PyTorch**: For deep learning implementations.
  - **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
  - **PyTorch3D**: For 3D operations and differentiable rendering.
  - **SMPL Model**: For human body modeling.
  - **Monocular Depth Estimation**: Models like **MiDaS**.
  - **Pose Estimation**: Libraries like **Detectron2** or **OpenPose**.
  - **Stable Diffusion (SD)**: For the diffusion-based decoder.
  - **Other Utilities**: NumPy, Matplotlib, FFmpeg.

- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - **GPUs**: NVIDIA GPUs with sufficient VRAM (e.g., A100, RTX 3090).
  - **CUDA and cuDNN**: Compatible versions with PyTorch.

#### **3. Data Preparation**

- **Dataset Creation**:
  - **Collect Real Videos**: Gather a dataset of real character videos without annotations.
  - **Generate Synthetic Videos**: Use tools like **En3D** to create synthetic character animations.
  - **HUD-7K Dataset**: Optionally, replicate the dataset mentioned in the paper (if permissible).

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - **Extract Frames**: Convert videos into sequences of frames.
  - **Depth Maps**: Use a pre-trained depth estimator to compute depth maps for each frame.
  - **Human Detection and Masking**:
    - Use models like **Detectron2** for human detection.
    - Generate binary masks for the human component.
  - **Occlusion Detection**:
    - Detect objects with depth values smaller than the human layer.
    - Generate masks for occluding objects.
  - **Scene Inpainting**:
    - Apply video inpainting methods (e.g., **ProPainter**) to recover background scenes.
  - **Mask Propagation**:
    - Use video tracking (e.g., **SAM^2** or **ByteTrack**) to maintain consistent masks across frames.

#### **4. Implement Hierarchical Spatial Layer Decomposition**

- **Depth-Based Layering**:
  - **Lift Pixels to 3D**: Associate each pixel with a depth value from the depth maps.
  - **Separate Layers**:
    - **Human Layer**: Extract using human masks.
    - **Occlusion Layer**: Extract using occlusion masks.
    - **Scene Layer**: Subtract human and occlusion layers from the original frame.
  - **Create Masklets**: Binary masks for each component over time.

- **Data Structures**:
  - **Video Clips**: Store frames and associated masks.
  - **Masks**: Use NumPy arrays for efficient computation.

#### **5. Implement Disentangled Human Encoding**

- **Structured Motion Encoding**:
  - **Estimate SMPL Parameters**:
    - Use models like **VIBE** or **SPIN** to estimate pose (`ùíÆ‚Çú`) and camera parameters (`ùíû‚Çú`).
  - **Anchor Latent Codes**:
    - Initialize latent codes (`ùíµ`) corresponding to SMPL vertices.
  - **Transform and Project**:
    - Apply pose transformations to `ùíµ`.
    - Project transformed codes to 2D using camera parameters.
  - **Pose Encoder**:
    - Implement a neural network to embed 2D feature maps (`‚Ñ±‚Çú`) into motion codes (`ùíû‚Çò‚Çí`).

- **Canonical Identity Encoding**:
  - **Human Reposing**:
    - Use a pre-trained model to repose the human to a canonical pose (A-pose).
    - Models like **ARCH** or **ARCH++** can be used.
  - **Identity Encoder**:
    - **Global Features**: Use a **CLIP** image encoder.
    - **Local Features**: Implement a **reference network** to capture fine details.
    - Combine features to form the identity code (`ùíû·µ¢d`).

#### **6. Implement Scene and Occlusion Encoding**

- **Shared VAE Encoder**:
  - Use a pre-trained **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** encoder.
  - Encode the inpainted scene (`v‚Çõ`) and occlusion (`v‚Çí`) components.
  - **Full Scene Code**: Concatenate `ùíû‚Çõ` and `ùíû‚Çí` to form `ùíû‚Çõ‚Çí`.

- **Encoder Architecture**:
  - Ensure the encoder can handle temporal data if processing sequences.

#### **7. Implement Composed Decoding with Diffusion Models**

- **Adapt Denoising U-Net**:
  - Use the U-Net architecture from **Stable Diffusion**.
  - Incorporate temporal convolutional layers for video data.
  - **Input Fusion**:
    - Concatenate the full scene code (`ùíû‚Çõ‚Çí`) with the latent noise.
    - Process through initial layers for alignment.

- **Conditioning Mechanisms**:
  - **Motion Code (`ùíû‚Çò‚Çí`)**: Add to features before entering the U-Net.
  - **Identity Code (`ùíû·µ¢d`)**:
    - Inject global features via cross-attention layers.
    - Inject local features via self-attention layers.

- **VAE Decoder**:
  - Use a pre-trained VAE decoder to reconstruct images from latent space.

#### **8. Training Process**

    - `x‚Çú`: Noised sample at timestep `t`.
    - `Œµ`: Gaussian noise.
    - `Œµ_Œ∏`: Denoising function implemented by the U-Net.

- **Optimization**:
  - **Optimizers**: Use Adam or AdamW with appropriate learning rates.
  - **Training Schedule**:
    - Set up training to run for around **50k iterations** with a **batch size of 4**.
    - Use **24 video frames** per batch as per the paper.

- **Hardware Setup**:
  - If available, use **Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)** training over multiple GPUs.
